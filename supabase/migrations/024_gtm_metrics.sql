-- Aggregate service metrics for the GTM digest in biz-tools
-- (prds/marketing.md, "Measurement" and "Automation requirements" item 4).
-- The gtm-metrics Edge Function calls this as the service role and returns
-- the result unchanged, so only counts leave Supabase: no rows, emails, or
-- IDs.
--
-- The window is whole UTC days, from the start of p_from to the end of
-- p_to. "Created", "joined", and "unsubscribed" counts fall inside the
-- window. Totals and "active" count rows created before the window ends,
-- in their current state: a deleted account or an unlinked installation
-- drops out of past windows too, and a member who left and rejoined only
-- counts by their latest unsubscribe time.
--
-- The alpha waitlist counts are null until 023_alpha_waitlist.sql has run,
-- so this migration does not depend on it. PL/pgSQL plans each statement
-- when it first runs, so the waitlist query below is never planned while
-- the table is missing.
