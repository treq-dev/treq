 * revalidates it for all. Loading it also writes matching fields into the
 * repo settings store on the backend, so this also revalidates the
 * `repo-settings` SWR key that `RepositorySettingsContent` reads from.
 *
 * `loading` stays true until one fetch has finished since this hook mounted
 * (or since `repoPath` changed). With a result cached by an earlier mount,
 * SWR returns it at once with `isLoading` false and only starts the refetch
 * on the next animation frame. Until that refetch ends, the cached config
 * and the repo settings it synced can be stale: fields from a file written
 * since the last mount would render enabled, with their old values.
