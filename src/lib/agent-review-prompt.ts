What is under review: {diff_summary}

Work through these steps in order.

1. List the comments this diff already has, so you do not repeat one:

     treq agent-review list --target-type {target_type} --target-id {target_id}

   This returns every comment on the diff, tagged by source: \`local-agent\`
   (earlier review runs), \`local-human\` (the user's own draft comments) and
   \`github\` (review threads on the pull request). Read them all.

2. Read the diff yourself (for example with \`treq diff\` or \`git diff\`), then
   look for correctness bugs, missed edge cases, unsafe error handling, and
   clear quality problems. Skip style nits the project's formatter already
   handles.

3. Drop any finding that a comment from step 1 already covers, whatever its
   source and whether or not it is marked resolved. Only a genuinely new
   finding gets a new comment.

4. Record every remaining finding as a local-only review comment with:

  treq agent-review add \\
    --target-type {target_type} \\
    --target-id {target_id} \\
    --file <path relative to the repo root> \\
    --start-line <first line> --end-line <last line> \\
    --side new \\
    --comment "<what is wrong and why it matters>"

When you can name the exact replacement for those lines, add a suggestion so the
user can apply it in one click:

    --suggestion "\\\`\\\`\\\`suggestion
<the replacement text for lines start-line..end-line>
\\\`\\\`\\\`"

Rules:
- One comment per finding, anchored to the narrowest line range that shows it.
- A suggestion must replace exactly the lines from --start-line to --end-line.
- Do not edit any files yourself. Leave comments only.
- Say nothing if the change is fine; do not invent findings to fill a quota.

When you are done, print a one-paragraph summary of what you reviewed and how
many comments you left.`;
