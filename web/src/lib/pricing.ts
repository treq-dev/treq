    question: 'What is free, and what do I pay for?',
    answer:
      "The desktop app is free and open source, and runs everything on your machine. GitHub works through your local gh CLI and Linear through a personal API key, for any repository. You pay for the features that run on Treq's servers: the Treq GitHub App, Linear OAuth, and two features in private alpha, the merge queue and a managed cloud workspace.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the Pro trial work?',
    answer:
      'Pro starts with a 14-day free trial. Checkout asks for a card, and Stripe charges it when the trial ends unless you cancel first. Each account gets one trial. If you cancel, Pro stays on until the end of the period you already have. Team has no trial.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do Team seats count?',
    answer:
      'Team costs US$199 per month and covers up to 5 members, the owner included. Pending invites count toward the 5, so revoke an invite you no longer need to free its seat. An invite link works once and expires after 7 days. A member who leaves or is removed loses Pro at once.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the desktop app still free on Pro?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Pro and Team are cloud subscriptions on top of the same open source desktop app. Your local workspaces stay on your machine either way.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I upgrade?',
    answer:
      'Create an account, then start Pro from the Subscription tab of your dashboard. For Team, create an organization on the Team tab, buy Team there, and send your teammates their invite links.',
