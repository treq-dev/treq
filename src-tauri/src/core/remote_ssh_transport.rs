//! Native Rust SSH transport (Phase 4: "Native desktop SSH").
//!
//! Replaces system `ssh` subprocesses with the pure-Rust [`russh`] client for
//! the managed transport path. This module owns exactly the responsibilities
//! listed under the PRD's "Native SSH transport" section:
//!
//! - strict host-key verification against Phase 3's [`TrustedHostKey`]s;
//! - user-key and certificate authentication ([`SshAuthentication`]);
//! - connection pooling and channel multiplexing;
//! - keepalives, reconnect, and stale-connection recovery;
//! - exec channels (non-interactive, JSON-producing) with deadlines,
//!   cancellation, and output limits;
//! - PTY channels for interactive shells and agents, with resize support.
//!
//! It consumes the domain types from [`crate::core::remote_control_plane`]
//! (`SshEndpoint`, `TrustedHostKey`, `SshEndpointSource`, `SshAuthentication`)
//! rather than redefining them. It does not implement JJ, Git, workspace, or
//! any other repository behavior: callers hand it a fully-formed
//! `treq <command> --format=json` argument vector and get back raw
//! stdout/stderr bytes plus an exit status; interpreting that JSON is Phase
//! 5's job.
//!
//! SFTP and port forwarding are out of scope, per the PRD.
