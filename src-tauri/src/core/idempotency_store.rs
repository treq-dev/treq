//
// Replaces the process-local `OnceLock<HashMap>` idempotency cache that used
// to live in `core::remote`. Remote SSH starts a fresh `treq` CLI process per
// exec channel, so a process-local cache cannot deduplicate a retry, or a
// concurrent invocation, that lands in a second process. This store persists
// idempotency records in the same repo-local SQLite database convention used
// by `local_db.rs` (`<repo>/.treq/local.db`), so a claim, its lifecycle
// state, and its result survive process exit and application restart.
//
// What is persisted: operation kind, idempotency key, a SHA-256 digest of
// the canonical request JSON (never the request body itself), lifecycle
// state, a redacted copy of the successful result, and timestamps. Request
// bodies can carry source contents, patch bodies, prompts, or credentials;
// none of that is ever written here, only its digest. Successful results are
// redacted before storage in case a result itself echoes sensitive input
// (e.g. `AgentStart`'s result includes the prompt it was given).
