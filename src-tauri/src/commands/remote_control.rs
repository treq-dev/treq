//! Tauri command surface for Phase 5 typed remote commands: probe/clone/init,
//! read-only review commands, remote mutations, and agent lifecycle.
//!
//! Every command here takes a fully-typed [`crate::core::remote::TreqCommandRequest`]
//! (allow-listed at the type level — Tauri's own JSON deserialization rejects
//! any shape that is not one of the enum's known variants) rather than a raw
//! command string, so the "no frontend-provided arbitrary command enters an
//! exec channel" requirement holds at the IPC boundary too, not only inside
//! the exec transport.
//!
//! `remote_dispatch_local` reuses exactly the same core dispatch
//! (`execute_local_request`) that the CLI itself calls, so results share one
//! DTO with the local Tauri path. `remote_dispatch_over_ssh` runs the same
//! typed request against a real `SshEndpoint` over the Phase 4 native
//! transport. Neither is wired into any component yet — that is Phase 6's
//! job — but both are real, callable, and tested.
